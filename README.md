# Solana Token Launchpad 

Web app designed to demonstrate the full lifecycle of deploying **SPL Tokens** on the Solana Blockchain.
This project works on devnet, using **Token_Program_2022** [TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA](https://solscan.io/account/TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA?cluster=devnet/) , which helps to add metadata to the token.

## 📸 How to Use the App

Make sure you have phantom downloaded in your extensions and have some [Devnet_Solana](https://faucet.solana.com/) in it.

### Step 2: Upload Metadata
Enter the **Name**, **Symbol**, and **Initial Supply** for your token. Select an image for your token. The app will automatically upload this to **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System) to create a permanent, decentralized link.

### Step 4: Create token and deployment
Click **Create Token**. Your wallet will pop up asking you to sign the transaction. This mints the token and sends the supply to your wallet.
